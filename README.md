# Kotlin Dice roller
 this is an android app (tested pixel 6) that will roll a dice with a button click. Dice will show random numbers for 10 seconds after which it "lands" and reveals the final rolled number. taken from the google kotlin developers course and expanded with the code delays and more verbose UI. 

main code can be found in main/java/com/example/rollingdice/MainActivity.kt

layout code for the display is at main/res/layout/activity_main.xml
